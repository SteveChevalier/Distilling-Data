# Distilling-Data - Example files for Distilling Data with MySQL
## This repository contains all the files referenced in the book.

Download these to a folder on your computer as required by the book and use MySQL to follow along and to experiment.

It's best to take the time while working through the book to modify these and try out your own ideas.  You can always come back to here and redownload if needed.

### File Descriptions
* start with "Chapter_xx" are the sql scripts containing the code discussed in the chapter
* start with "schema_data_xx" are the sql scripts that create the schema, tables and data for the given chapter.
Note that some of these files are "zip" files as they were too big for github to accept.  They will need to be decompressed on your system prior to use.

### Folder Descriptions
* Some of the data sets covered in the book have additional data used to complete the analysis. 
* This folders also contain the data as it was gathered from the source.  This is helpful if you want to recreate the "mining" and "data cleaning" described in the chapters that cover them.  Data mining and cleaning is a VERY BIG part of the Data Analysis / Science work flow.  Often these steps take up most of the time in performing these studies.

These files also include spreadsheets and R programming code that was used along the way.

Please ping me if there are issues or questions.

Thanks!!!!
