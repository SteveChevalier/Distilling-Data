# Distilling-Data - Example files for Distilling Data with MySQL
## This repository contains all the files referenced in the book.

Download these to a folder on your computer as required by the book and use MySQL to follow along and to experiment.

It's best to take the time while working through the book to modify these and try out your own ideas.  You can always come back to here and redownload if needed.

These files also include spreadsheets and R programming code that was used along the way.

Please ping me if there are issues or questions.

Thanks!!!!
